				<div class="faq_answer">
					<p>CloudScript lowers your operations costs per server. We do
						this by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>* Reducing your human costs</li>
						<li>* Improving the quality of your operations</li>
						<li>* Reducing troubleshooting times</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="cb">&nbsp;</div>
					<p>We help you automate the testing that is usually performed
						manually by technology staff when making changes to desktops and
						servers. The result is an automated test suite that runs 100's of
						tests per minute against your applications, systems and
						infrastructure.</p>
					<p>cloudscript gives you peace of mind around changes. Knowing
						that you have a safety net will allow you to implement changes
						faster and enable you and your team to be more agile in the face
						of the constant stream of changes your business demands.</p>

				<div class="faq_answer">
					<p>Up until now, testing the configuration of systems has been
						mostly a manual process. Both before and after changes,
						technology teams must carry out manual checks to confirm the
						systems they are changing are configured correctly.</p>
					<p>For complex and/or critical systems, changes carry a higher
						level of risk. This means that these type of checks are required

						was preventing the uptake of test automation in this space.</p>
